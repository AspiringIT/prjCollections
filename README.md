A Prime Number is an integer (other than 1) that is only 
evenly divisible by itself and 1. For example, the number
five is prime because ot can only be evenly divided by 1 and 5.
The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided 
by1,2,3, and 6.

(starting at 2) in a list. Use an iterator to display the numbers
